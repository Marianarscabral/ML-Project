## **Predicting Hospital Readmissions**

* This repository contains the project developed for the **Machine Learning** course  as part of the MDSAA program at NOVAIMS.

#### Project Objectives

The project consists of two primary objectives:

1. **Binary Classification**: Develop a model to predict if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days post-discharge. Such a model can aid healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients and implementing preventive measures.
  
2. **Multiclass Classification**: Classify patient readmissions into three categories—"No readmission," "readmission within 30 days," and "readmission after 30 days." This provides a more granular risk stratification for post-discharge planning.


#### Impact

* The final model provides predictions that can be used to improve discharge planning, reduce readmission rates, and potentially save on healthcare costs by enabling timely intervention for high-risk patients.

#### Project Files
* This project’s deliverables include the Jupyter notebook with the full workflow and a report summarizing the findings and methodologies used.
